This version is written by [@parisba](https://twitter.com/parisba) from [Secret Lab](https://secretlab.games) and [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev).  It's entirely based on [Kenney's version](https://github.com/KenneyNL/Starter-Kit-3D-Platformer), updated to use C#. It's currently just a quick port, but I'll clean it up over the coming weeks.

We're currently writing a book on [building games in Godot with C#, sign-up for updates here](http://secretlab.games/books/godot).
